From Sous Chef to Head Chef.

      Imagine a chef comes to you with a recipe and asks you to find and prepare all the ingredients for a cooking show she’s doing. You research the best ingredients - you go to local farmers, visit their farms, taste their products, make orders. You find cheesemongers, butchers, and carefully select the best cheeses and meats. You research and order the best olive oil and sherry vinegar from Spain - you even plant some herbs yourself so that she’ll have the freshest seasoning. When harvest time comes, you run around getting the fresh ingredients. In the kitchen, you chop and prepare all the ingredients and put out pre-measured amounts in pretty bowls like you see on cooking shows. The chef comes in (maybe they’re filming a show), throws the ingredients together, cooks them, and serves it. Everyone loves it! They thank and applaud the wonderful chef - she goes on to write beautiful cookbooks. You’re devastated. Only behind the scenes is your hard work recognized and rewarded. 

     While cooking of course takes skill, any chef worth his salt knows that the best dishes are made with the best ingredients. Good machine learning models are no different. There’s commonly quoted phrase for why  a model might not be working well:  Garbage in, garbage out.  Building a good machine learning model starts with having a good dataset. It should be formatted consistently, be representative of and accurately capture the behavior you’re trying to model, and have consistent (but accurate) labeling, the categories we want to predict should be intuitive and useful for whatever final action is taken based on the model’s prediction. For the last 8 years, I have been helping the chef and now ready to become the head chef. 

     Not only have I done all the prep work to hand off to a chef, I’ve tasted the outcome of the recipe to go back and fix or change the ingredients. In model speak, I’ve done enough model error analysis to know how best to fix data that was labeled incorrectly. Every now and then I can’t figure out why the model is predicting an incorrect category, and the scientist had to dig into the model to figure out why. (Eventually, we found that it was a data sparsity problem.)  Over time, I’ve acquired an intuition (combined with my linguistic background) for what the model can and can’t learn. I’d like to unravel that intuition by understanding and building machine learning models. 

     While being able to do the end-to-end modeling, may be a satisfying from a growth mindset perspective.  Over the course of my career, I’ve seen reliance on data and machine learning grow in the industry. While crowdsourcing and data management has been increasingly outsourced, at the same time businesses progressively rely on data intelligence for business decisions. The next step for me is to formalize my data analysis duties and make a greater impact in my field.


     And lastly, I’d like to do a data science course so that I can test the theories I build while immersing myself in the data.  As a linguist, you are trained to know how meaning is built and how we decode human language in different contexts. I want to be able to test and build into models the same features or knowledge humans use. While doing data analysis for my PhD, I found it very satisfying to scientifically test a theory I had formed while annotating data. In some cases, I was proved wrong and in other cases correct. Statistics was able to tease apart those different intuitions by testing the different factors in the data. As we are able to encode more complex features, simple statistics may not be enough.  We need machine learning models to better approximate that human intelligence. What better way to approximate intelligence than through language. It’s an exciting time for a linguist to get into the field of data science!
